Here we've tried combinations that are increasingly complex, combined with training for longer, until the error falls below our objective. This may not be the best combination; others may attain an even lower RMSE. If your aim is to find the model that can attain the best error, then you'll want to use a more rigorous process, like a parameter search."]},{"metadata":{"id":"IjkpSqmxqnSM","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":["dnn_regressor = train_nn_regression_model(\n","    learning_rate=0.001,\n","    steps=2000,\n","    batch_size=100,\n","    hidden_units=[10, 10],\n","    training_examples=training_examples,\n","    training_targets=training_targets,\n","    validation_examples=validation_examples,\n","    validation_targets=validation_targets)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"c6diezCSeH4Y","colab_type":"text","slideshow":{"slide_type":"slide"}},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Task 2: Evaluate on Test Data\n","\n","**Confirm that your validation performance results hold up on test data.**\n","\n","Once you have a model you're happy with, evaluate it on test data to compare that to validation performance.\n","\n","Reminder, the test data set is located [here](https://download.mlcc.google.com/mledu-datasets/california_housing_test.csv)."]},{"metadata":{"id":"icEJIl5Vp51r","colab_type":"code","cellView":"both","colab":{"test":{"output":"ignore","timeout":600},"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"outputId":"d1ca8291-f7e9-41bc-ca53-ede73da1f1b0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1546563107695,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":2575,"user":{"displayName":"Arthur Flôr","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-faBWPHTtYFg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAGM8/LtqA5IfLAY8/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"18307190246767032097"}}},"cell_type":"code","source":["california_housing_test_data = pd.read_csv(\"https://download.mlcc.google.com/mledu-datasets/california_housing_test.csv\", sep=\",\")\n","\n","test_examples = preprocess_features(california_housing_test_data)\n","test_targets = preprocess_targets(california_housing_test_data)\n","\n","predict_testing_input_fn = lambda: my_input_fn(test_examples, test_targets[\"median_house_value\"], num_epochs=1, shuffle=False)\n","\n","test_predictions = dnn_regressor.predict(input_fn=predict_testing_input_fn)\n","test_predictions = np.array([item['predictions'][0] for item in test_predictions])\n","\n","root_mean_squared_error = math.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(test_predictions, test_targets))\n","\n","print(\"Final RMSE (on test data): %s\" % root_mean_squared_error)"],"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Final RMSE (on test data): 105.484169776\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"id":"vvT2jDWjrKew","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Solution\n","\n","Click below to see a possible solution."]},{"metadata":{"id":"FyDh7Qy6rQb0","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Similar to what the code at the top does, we just need to load the appropriate data file, preprocess it and call predict and mean_squared_error.\n","\n","Note that we don't have to randomize the test data, since we will use all records."]},{"metadata":{"id":"vhb0CtdvrWZx","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":["california_housing_test_data = pd.read_csv(\"https://download.mlcc.google.com/mledu-datasets/california_housing_test.csv\", sep=\",\")\n","\n","test_examples = preprocess_features(california_housing_test_data)\n","test_targets = preprocess_targets(california_housing_test_data)\n","\n","predict_testing_input_fn = lambda: my_input_fn(test_examples, \n","                                               test_targets[\"median_house_value\"], \n","                                               num_epochs=1, \n","                                               shuffle=False)\n","\n","test_predictions = dnn_regressor.predict(input_fn=predict_testing_input_fn)\n","test_predictions = np.array([item['predictions'][0] for item in test_predictions])\n","\n","root_mean_squared_error = math.sqrt(\n","    metrics.mean_squared_error(test_predictions, test_targets))\n","\n","print(\"Final RMSE (on test data): %0.2f\" % root_mean_squared_error)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
