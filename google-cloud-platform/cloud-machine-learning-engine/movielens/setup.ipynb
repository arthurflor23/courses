[Google Cloud Machine Learning (ML) Engine](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/) is a managed service that enables developers and data scientists to build and bring superior machine learning models to production. Cloud ML Engine offers training and prediction services, which can be used together or individually. Cloud ML Engine is a proven service used by enterprises to solve problems ranging from identifying [clouds in satellite images](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/google-cloud-machine-learning-now-open-to-all-with-new-professional-services-and-education-programs), ensuring [food safety](https://blog.google/products/google-cloud/how-google-cloud-transforming-japanese-businesses/), and responding four times faster to [customer emails](https://cloud.google.com/customers/ocado/).\n","\n","b.

Following files are used in the sample:\n","\n","### Ratings\n","\n","All ratings are contained in the file `ratings.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one rating of one movie by one user, and has the following format:\n","```\n","    userId, movieId, rating, timestamp\n","```\n","\n","The lines within this file are ordered first by userId, then, within user, by movieId.\n","\n","Ratings are made on a 5-star scale, with half-star increments (0.5 stars - 5.0 stars).\n","\n","Timestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.\n","\n","### Movies\n","\n","Movie information is contained in the file `movies.csv`.
